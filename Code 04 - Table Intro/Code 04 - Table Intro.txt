-- Code 04 - Table Intro-- Can be copied into Codea-- Bruce Elliott-- April 2013-- Use this function to perform your initial setupfunction setup()-- Create a table named kTab the name is not important-- use a name that helps document your code---- in Codea each table entry consists of two parts.-- Here the first part are the numbers 1 to 15.---- The second part of each entry is text. Here a single character.    kTab={}    kTab[1] = "1"    kTab[2] = "2"    kTab[3] = "3"    kTab[4] = "4"    kTab[5] = "5"    kTab[6] = "6"    kTab[7] = "7"    kTab[8] = "8"    kTab[9] = "9"    kTab[10] = "0"    kTab[11] = "+"    kTab[12] = "-"    kTab[13] = "*"    kTab[14] = "/"    kTab[15] = "="    -- Display the table entries-- A for loop steps through a sequence of values---- We are using pairs to access the table keys and values-- for each key (k) we want to get its value (v)-- We have to tell pairs which table to process-- -- We display each key followed by its value-- Note: .. is used to concatenate (attach)-- parts of the output string        for k, v in pairs(kTab) do        print(k.." "..v)    end-- Here we use print to display the value-- with key 12.    print("val: "..kTab[12])end
