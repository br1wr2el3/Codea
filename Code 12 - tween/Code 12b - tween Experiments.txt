--# Main-- Code 12b - tween Experiments-- Bruce Elliott-- April 2013-- In App 5b we looked at  creating a tween to move an-- object from one corner of the screen to the opposite corner.-- The purpose was to demonstrate the basics of using a tween with and with-out-- an easing function.-- easing functions add some visual "eye-candy" but the basic idea is still to get -- from one point to another.-- Take a look at the Codea example program Animation.-- This demo shows off a lot of features of using tweens-- My problem is figureing out how to use any of those-- features in my own code.-- After doing the Appetizer for tweens I have a much better-- idea of what to do.-- If I understand the process, it involves two basic steps:-- 1. Set up the tween definition pay attention to parameter two--    the object table with x and y-- 2. Use those values in the draw function with the object--    you want to move, like a circle or a sprite-- In this recipe we will examine many of the features shown-- in the example. There may be several example programs.function setup()        -- obj, obj1, and obj2 tables with three table elements:    -- (Notice that obj and obj2 are the same)        obj = {x = 100, y = 100, size = 50}    obj1 = {x = WIDTH/2, y = HEIGHT/2, size = 100}    obj2 = {x = 100, y = 100, size = 50}        -- time = 5 seconds    -- target is x = width, y = height, and size = 200    -- loop is inside a table equal to loop type--    t1 = tween(5, obj, {x = WIDTH/2, y = HEIGHT/2, size = 100})--    t2 = tween(5, obj, {x = 100, y = 100, size = 50})--    t3 = tween(5, obj, obj2)--    t5 = tween(5, obj, {x = WIDTH, y = HEIGHT, size = 200})--    t4 = tween(5, obj, {x = WIDTH, y = HEIGHT, size = 200},--     {loop = tween.loop.pingpong})--    t6 = tween(5, obj, obj1)    -- t3 will never execute in sequence           --  tween.sequence(t1, t4, t3)  --      tween.sequence(t1, t5, t2)    -- After running sequence with t4 I got ping pong    -- even when it was not in the sequence    -- used reset(t4) to disable    -- Sometimes run would not start sequence    -- Finally commented t4 to disable    -- putting first id in seq twice appears to disable all versions    -- using any id twice may not workend-- This function gets called once every framefunction draw()    -- This sets a dark background color     background(40, 40, 50) --  tween.reset(t4)    -- This sets the line thickness    strokeWidth(5)    -- Do your drawing here    -- Note use of all three table values    ellipse(obj.x, obj.y, obj.size)    end
