--# Main-- Code 12d - tween path-- Bruce Elliott-- April 2013-- Accepts a table of waypoints to follow-- Setup multiple destinations or stop points-- strt is the starting point-- t1 - t5 are waypoints for the path-- Then you will find four tweens - only one-- at a time should be uncommented. The last tween-- takes two lines so comment or uncomment carefully-- Use this function to perform your initial setupfunction setup()    strt = {x = WIDTH, y = HEIGHT, size = 20}        t1 = {x = 102, y = 100, size = 10}    t2 = {x = 200, y = 500, size = 50}    t3 = {x = WIDTH/2, y = HEIGHT/2, size = 100}    t4 = {x = WIDTH/4, y = HEIGHT/4, size = 10}    t5 = {x = 300, y = 200, size = 75}      --  tween.path(20, strt, {strt, t1, t2, t3, t4,  t5 ,t1}) --   tween.path(20, strt, {strt, t1, t2, t3, t4,  t5 ,t1, strt})    tween.path(20, strt, {t1, t2, t3, t4,  t5 ,t1, strt}) --   tween.path(20, strt, {strt, t1, t2, t3, t4,  t5 ,t1} --   , {loop=tween.loop.forever})end-- This function gets called once every framefunction draw()    -- This sets a dark background color      background(40, 40, 50)        noFill()    -- This sets the line thickness    strokeWidth(2)        -- The object moved during the path execution    -- note that even though strt is the final    -- waypoint the path never seems to return    -- there    -- If strt is the first waypoint the path will    -- start there but, even with a loop, we never    -- seem to return there        ellipse(strt.x, strt.y, strt.size)    end
