--# Main-- Code 12a - tween-- Bruce Elliott-- April 2013-- In App 5b we looked at  creating a tween to move an-- object from one corner of the screen to the opposite corner.-- The purpose was to demonstrate the basics of using a tween with and with-out-- an easing function.-- easing functions add some visual "eye-candy" but the basic idea is still to get -- from one point to another.-- Take a look at the Codea example program Animation.-- This demo shows off a lot of features of using tweens-- My problem is figureing out how to use any of those-- features in my own code.-- After doing the Appetizer for tweens I have a much better-- idea of what to do.-- If I understand the process, it involves two basic steps:-- 1. Set up the tween definition pay attention to parameter two--    the object table with x and y-- 2. Use those values in the draw function with the object--    you want to move, like a circle or a sprite-- In this recipe we will examine many of the features shown-- in the example. There may be several example programs.function setup()        -- obj is a table with three table elements:    -- x = 100, y = 100, size = 50    obj = {x = 100, y = 100, size = 50}        -- time = 5 seconds    -- target is x = width, y = height, and size = 200    -- loop is inside a table equal to loop type    t1 = tween(5, obj, {x = WIDTH, y = HEIGHT, size = 200})    t2 = tween(5, obj, {x = WIDTH, y = HEIGHT, size = 200},        {loop = tween.loop.pingpong})    t3 = tween(5, obj, {x = WIDTH, y = HEIGHT, size = 200},        tween.easing.bounceInOut)    t4 = tween(5, obj, {x = WIDTH, y = HEIGHT, size = 200},         {easing = tween.easing.bounceOutIn,            loop = tween.loop.pingpong}) --   t5 = tween(5, obj, {x = WIDTH, y = HEIGHT, size = 200},  --       {tween.easing.bounceOutIn, tween.loop.pingpong})    t6 = tween(5, obj, {x = WIDTH, y = HEIGHT, size = 200},        {easing = tween.easing.bounceInOut,             loop = tween.loop.once}, endIt)    end -- This function gets called once every framefunction draw()    -- This sets a dark background color     background(40, 40, 50)    -- This sets the line thickness    strokeWidth(5) --   tween.stopAll()    tween.stop(t1)    tween.stop(t2)    tween.stop(t3)    tween.stop(t4) --   tween.stop(t6)    -- Do your drawing here    -- Note use of all three table values    ellipse(obj.x, obj.y, obj.size)    endfunction endIt()    print("endIt")    print("Done")end
